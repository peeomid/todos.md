- Added specs for cli architecture and commands
- Removed vault references; user specifies input files explicitly via `files` config
- Removed `week` metadata field completely from all specs, schema, and lint rules
- Implemented `tmd index` inherited values (area from project, energy defaults to 'normal', created defaults to today) - written to todos.json only, not back to markdown
- Updated `missing-id` lint rule to not be auto-fixable (use `tmd enrich` instead)
- Deleted `invalid-week-format` lint rule
- Implemented `tmd enrich` command: converts shorthands (!,>,~,? and @today/@upcoming/@anytime/@someday), auto-generates IDs, adds created/updated dates
- Fixed CLI help flag priority bug (command-specific --help now works correctly)
- All 27 tests passing
- Implemented `tmd list` command with full filtering (project, area, energy, due, overdue, status, tags, parent, top-level), sorting, grouping, and output formats (compact, full, json)
- Implemented `tmd show <id>` command for viewing single task details with hierarchy info
- Implemented `tmd done <id>` command with cascade to children, reindex, and --json output
- Implemented `tmd undone <id>` command (no cascade per spec), reindex, and --json output
- Implemented `tmd add <project> "<text>"` command with --parent for subtasks, metadata options (energy, est, due, plan, bucket, area, tags), auto ID generation
- Created src/editor/ module with task-editor.ts, id-generator.ts, task-inserter.ts
- Fixed hierarchy.ts bug: childrenLocalIds not populating due to duplicate localIds across projects (now uses composite key projectId:localId)
- Added parseRelativeDate to date-utils.ts for --plan today/tomorrow support
- Spec change: sync markers now use `<!-- tmd:start query="..." -->` / `<!-- tmd:end -->` (HTML comments, hidden in rendered MD)
- Spec change: filter syntax unified to key:value (e.g., `status:open bucket:today`) for both CLI and sync blocks
- Added command specs: `tmd search` (text: filter wrapper), `tmd stats` (metrics), `tmd block-template` (sync block generator)
- Added Priority field to schema (high, normal, low) with (A)/(B)/(C) shorthand parsing in enrich command
- Updated `tmd list` to use key:value filter syntax with new filters: priority:, bucket:, plan:, text:
- Added priority and bucket sorting/grouping to list command
- Implemented `tmd search` command as thin wrapper over list with text: filter
- Implemented `tmd edit <id>` command with --energy, --priority, --due, --plan, --bucket, --area, --tags, --add-tag, --remove-tag flags
- Implemented `tmd stats` command with byProject/byArea/byBucket/byEnergy metrics, period filtering (today, last-7d, last-30d, this-week)
- Implemented `tmd sync` command with bidirectional sync: Phase 1 (PULL) reads done tasks from views, Phase 2 (PUSH) regenerates view blocks
- Created src/sync/ module with tmd-block.ts (parse/replace blocks), task-renderer.ts (render tasks as markdown)
- Added `views` array to config schema for configuring sync view files
- Implemented `tmd block-template` command with presets (today, upcoming, anytime, someday, light, week, overdue)
- Added `--fix` support to lint command for duplicate-tags rule (deduplicates tags in metadata)
- Added LintFix interface and optional fix() method to LintRule
- Updated help.ts with all new commands
- Drafted spec for `tmd init` command (workspace scaffolding, default config, starter view, quickstart checklist)
- Implemented `tmd interactive` / `tmd i` full-screen TUI (2025-12-19): views 0–5 + config views, live search, task editing, `mtime` safety, reindex+sync on exit
- Extracted shared query logic to `src/query/filters.ts` and extended sorting for TUI (stable multi-sort, includes plan)
- Extended date parsing to support `+Nd` and `+Nw` shortcuts (used by TUI and `tmd add`)
- Updated TUI task lists to group by project (all views) and improved color styling for task text vs metadata (2025-12-19)
- Updated TUI footer to always show help below task details (2025-12-19)
- Updated TUI header tabs to highlight the current view with a background color (2025-12-19)
- Added footer separator line between details and help in the TUI (2025-12-19)
- Improved TUI search UX (apply/cancel, trailing space, free-text) and added delete-with-confirmation + TUI architecture doc (2025-12-19)
- Added `?` shorthand help overlay in the TUI (priority/bucket shorthands) (2025-12-19)
- Changed TUI delete keybinding to `r` and made `x` an alias for toggle done (2025-12-19)
